This is my mini project for the OOLT.Lab course (Object-oriented Language Theory) in my university. Our team has 3 members working on this project for 2 weeks. We got an A+ (9.5/10) after all.

My main role as team leader:
- Create feature set
- Create wireframe
- Design the architecture of application: MVC, Class diagram
- Code the visualizer for bubble sort algorithm.
- Guide other members to work with Trello and Bitbucket.

We used Trello to track our progress:
