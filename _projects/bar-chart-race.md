The main purpose of this project is to learn d3.js. The animation is then rendered to a video for the mar-com team in my company to use. 

My main role as developer:
- Preprocess the data (.xlsx file) to .json file
- Build bar chart race animation with d3.js
- Use Screen recorder to record the animation

Here is a screenshot from the animation:
