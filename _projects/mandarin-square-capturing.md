This is my mini project for the AI course (Artificial Intelligence) in my university. Our team has 4 members working on this project for 3 weeks.

My main role as team leader:
- Construct game logic and design program architecture.
- Guide other members to use Git.

Mandarin square capturing is a traditional board game in Vietnam. It's known as "Ô ăn quan" in Vietnamese. Our application is to build this game with AI player. We implemented two algorithms: minimax and expectimax for AI player. The application is written in Python with the help of pygame library.

Here are the main screen of our app:
