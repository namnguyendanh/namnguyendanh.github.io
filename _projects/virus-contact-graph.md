Date: Mar 2020

This project was an order from the mar-com team in my company. It is used in a campaign to promote our company's website. I've built the graph for about 4 days. The next 3 days are for styling the graph. All the data is collected by marcom team.

You can interact with the graph with some functionalities:
- Zoom in/out
- Drag/drop


My main role as developer:
- Preprocess the data (.xlsx file) to .json file (nodes, groups and links)
- Build a force-directed graph with d3.js

Here are some screenshots of my project:
