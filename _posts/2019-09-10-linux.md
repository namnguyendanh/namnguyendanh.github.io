## Introduction
Sử dụng Linux là một kỹ năng cực kỳ quan trọng của bất kỳ lập trình viên nào. Có rất nhiều tài liệu trên mạng, bạn có thể xem list những sách được đề xuất tại [đây](https://www.adminschoice.com/top-10-must-have-books-for-unix-and-linux-administartors). Mình đã chọn ra 2 cuốn để có thể học và hiểu sâu hơn về Linux:
- How Linux Works: What Every Superuser Shold Know
- The Linux Command Line 

## How to learn Linux
- Học đi đôi với hành
- Luôn đặt ra các câu hỏi


**Question**:
- Kernel mode vs User mode ?
- What is the page table ?
<br><br><br>

## Chapter 1. The Big Picture
The most effective way to understand how an OS works is through *abstraction*.

### 1.1 Levels and Layers of Abstraction in a Linux System
A Linux system has 3 main levels:
- **Hardware**: Processor (CPU), Main Memory (RAM), Disks, Network Ports,...
- **Linux Kernel**: The core of the OS. The kernel is software residing in memory that tells the CPU what to do. The kernal manages the hardware and acts primiarily as an interface between the hardware and any running program.
- **User Processes**: the running programs that the kernel manages

Kernel chạy trong *kernel mode*, ko bị giới hạn truy cập tới processor và main memory. Vùng mà chỉ kernel có thể truy cập gọi là *kernel space*. Ngoài ra, ta cũng có *user mode* và *user space*, bị giới hạn truy cập tới memory và CPU, 

### 1.2 Hardware: Understanding Main Memory
A CPU is just an operator on memory.

### 1.3 Kernel
Kernel quản lý:
- **Processes**: quyết định processes nào được dùng CPU
- **Memory**: keep track of all memory
- **Device Drivers**: kernel hoạt động giống như interface giữa hardware và processes.
- **System calls and support**: Processes normally use system calls to communicate with the kernel.

> NOTE: 
If you’re interested in the detailed workings of a kernel, two good textbooks are Operating System
Concepts, 9th edition, by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne (Wiley, 2012)
and Modern Operating Systems, 4th edition, by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos (Prentice
Hall, 2014).

#### 1.3.1 Process Management
*Process management* describes the starting, pausing, resuming, and terminating of processes.

**Context switch**: The act of one process giving up control of the CPU to another process

**Time slice**: gives a process enough time for significant computation.

Đấy là lý do, many processes run “simultaneously.”. Kernel chịu trách nhiệm cho context switching. Quá trình trao trả quyền dùng CPU, chuyển kernel mode và user mode có thể đọc thêm trong sách.

#### 1.3.2 Memory Management
**Memory management unit (MMU)**

The implementation of a memory address map is called a page table.

#### 1.3.3 Device Drivers and Management
Device drivers have traditionally been part of the kernel,
and they strive to present a uniform interface to user processes in order to simplify the software developer’s
job.

#### 1.3.4 System Calls and Support
Có một số features của kernel dành cho user processes. Ví dụ quan trọng:
- `fork()`: Khi một process gọi fork() thì kernel creates a nearly identical copy of the process
- `exec()`: Khi một process gọi exec(program) thì kernel starts program, replacing the current process.

![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/fork_exec.png)

Ngoài các syscalls thì còn có các features khác, tiêu biểu là *pseudodevices* (look like devices to user processes, but they're implemented purely in software).

### 1.4 User Space
The main memory that the kernel allocates for user processes is called user space, user space also refers to the memory for the entire collection of running processes.

Hầu hết các hoạt trên Linux system xảy ra ở user space. Dù tất cả các processes đều công bằng dưới góc độ của kernel, nhưng đối với user thì nó được phân cấp: basic services, utility services, applications. 

![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/process_type.png)

Generally, if one component wants to use another, the second component is either at the same service level or
below.

### 1.5 Users
The Linux kernel supports the traditional concept of a Unix user.

- **User**: an entity that can run processes and own files. A user is associated with a *username*, the kernel identifies users by *userids*. User exist primarily to support permissions and boundaries.
- **Root**: root may terminate and alter another user's processes and read any file on the local system. A person who can operate as root is said to have *root access* and is an administator on a traditional Unix system.
- **Groups**: sets of users. The primary purpose of groups is to allow a user to share file access to other users in a group.


<br><br><br>

## Chapter 2. Basic Commands and Directory Hierarchy

- **shell**: a program that runs commands. The shell also serves as a small programming environment. `bash`: enhanced version of Bourne Shell.
- **shell scripts**: text files that contain a sequence of shell commands

### Stdin, Stdout, Stderr
- **Stdin & Stdout**: Processes read data from input streams and write data to output streams. The source of an input stream can be a file, a device, a terminal, or even the output stream from aother process.

- Redirect: `>` 
- Append: `>>`
- Send sdtout to f and stderr to e: `ls /fff > f 2> e`
- Send stderr to the same place as stdout: `ls /fff > f 2>&1`
- Stdin Redirection: Use `<`, not very common.

### 2.4 Navigating Directories
#### Shell Globbing (Wildcards)
- `*`: expansion
- `?`: one character

Enclose the lob in single quotes '' to prevent the shell from expanding a glob. Ex: `echo '*'` to print a star

### 2.5 Some Commands
Đọc thêm cuốn The Command Line Linux.

- `grep`: prints the lines from a file or input stream that match an expression. grep understands *regex*.
- `less`: an enhanced version of `more`
- `diff`: to see the differences between two text files
- `file`: use to see the format of a file.
- `find`: Ex: `find dir -name file -print`. The find command accpets special pattern-matching characters, but you must enclose them in single quote to prevent it from shell's globbing feature.
- `head` and `tail`
- `sort`: put the lines of a text file in alphanumeric order.
- `passwd`: change password

> NOTE:  To learn more, you can read Mastering Regular Expressions, 3rd edition (O’Reilly, 2006). If you like math and are interested in where regular expressions come from, look up Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation, 3rd edition (Prentice Hall, 2006).

### 2.8 Environment and Shell Variables
- Assign a value to a shell variable (temporary): `STUFF=blah`
- Access this variable: `$STUFF`

**environment varialbe**: like a shell varable, but it's not specific to the shell.

- Assign an environment variable: `export STUFF`
- `PATH`: a special environment variable that contains the *command path*. A command path is a list of system directories that the shell searches when trying to locate a command.
- Add a directory to PATH: `PATH=dir:$PATH` or `PATH:$PATH:dir`

### Command-Line Editing
![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/keystrokes.png)

### 2.13 Getting Online Help
`man` and `info`

### 2.15 Understanding Error Messagese
#### 2.15.1 Anatomy of a UNIX Error Message

Example: `ls: cannot access /dsafsda: No such file or directory`

When troubleshooting errors, always address the first error first.

#### 2.15.2 Common Errors
- Segmentation fault: the program tried to access a part of memory that it was not allowed to touch, and the OS killed it.
- Bus error: the program tried to acces some memory in a particular way that it shouldn't.

### 2.16 Listing and Manipulating Processes
Use `ps`. Each process has PID.

The fields are as follows:
- PID
- TTY: the terminal device where the process is running
- STAT: the process status. S means sleeping, R means running.
- TIME: the amount of CPU time in minutes and seconds that the process has used so far
- COMMAND

#### 2.16.1 Command Options
- `ps x`: show all of your running processes
- `ps ax`: show all processes on the system, not just the ones you own.
- `ps u`: include more detailed information on processes
- `ps w`: show full command names, not just what fits on one line

So, you can combine options to `ps auxw` or `ps aux`.

To inspect the current shell process: use `ps u $$`, where `$$` is the variable contains the current shell's PID.

#### 2.16.2 Killing Processes
To terminate a process, send it a signal with the kill command. A signal is a message to a process from the kernel. The default signal is TERM (terminate). 

`kill pid`

To freeze a process instead of terminateing it, use STOP. Use CONT signal to continue running the process again.

`kill -STOP pid`

`kill -CONT pid`

The most brutal way to terminate a process is with KILL signal (`kill -KILL` or `kill -9`). Other signals give the process a chance to clean up after itself, but KILL does not.

#### 2.16.3 Job Control
Shell support *job control*, which is a way to send `TSTP` (similar to STOP) and `CONT` signals to programs by using various keystrokes and commands.

- Send `TSTP` with Ctrl+Z.
- Start the process again by entering `fb` (bring to foreground) or `bg` (move to background)
- Run `jobs` to see if you suspended any processes.

#### 2.16.4 Background Processes
- Using `&`, the shell should respond by printing the PID of the new background process. If a program tries to read something from stdin when it's in the background, it can freeze (try `fg` to bring it back) or terminate. Also, if the program writes to the stdout or stderr, you can get unexpected output when you're working on something else. -> need to redirect its output (and input).

### 2.17 File Modes and Permissions

Every Unix file has a set of *permissions* that determine whether you can r, w, or x the file.

Ex: `-rw-r--r-- 1 minhdq99hp ict04 7041 Mar 26 19:34 endnotes.html`

![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/permissions.png)

- The user permissions pertain to the user who owns the file (minhdq99hp)
- The group permissions are for the file's group (ict04)
- The other permissions are for everyone else on the system.

Some executable files have an `s` in the user permissions listing instead of an `x`. This indicates that the executable is `setuid`, meaning that when you execute the program, it runs as though the file owner is the user instead of you.

#### 2.17.1 Modifying Permissions
- `g` stands for group, `o` stands for other

Ex: `chmod go+r file`, `chmod g-x file`

Absolute change: `chmod 644 file`

![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/absolute_permissions.png)

Directories also have permissions. You can list the contents of a dir if it is `r`, but you can only access a file in a directory if the directory is `x`.

You can specify a set of default permissions with `umask` cmd, which applies a predefined set of permissions to any new file you create.

Ex: `umask 022` if you want everyone to be able to see all of the files and directories that you create.

#### 2.17.2 Symbolic Links
- **Symbolic link**: a file that points to another file or a dir.

`ln -s target linkname`

### 2.18 Archiving and Compressing Files
#### gzip
- `gunzip file.gz` to uncompress.
- `gzip file` to compress.

`gzip` does not create archives of files (multiple files and dirs).
#### tar
- `tar cvf archive.tar file1 file2 ...` to compress
- `tar xvf archive.tar` to uncompress
- `tar tvf archive.tar` to check the contents of a .tar file before extracting.

#### Compressed Archives (.tar.gz)
`gunzip file.tar.gz && tar xvf file.tar`

A better way:

`zcat file.tar.gz | tar xvf -`

or 

`tar zxvf file.tar.gz`

Note: `.tgz` is the same as `.tar.gz`.

#### 2.18.5 Other Compression Utilities


### 2.19 Linux Directory Hierarchy Essentials
![](/images/2019-09-10-linux/directory_hierarchy.png)

- `/bin`: executable programs.
- `/dev`: device files.
- `/etc`: core system configuration.
- `/home`: personal directories for regular users.
- `/lib`: lib files.
- `/proc`: system statistics
- `/sys`: 
- `/sbin`: system executables.
- `/tmp`: storage for files that you don't care much about.
- `/usr`: include the bulk of the Linux system.
- `/var`: The variable subdirectory, where programs record runtime information. System logging, user tracking, caches, and other files that ysstem programs creaet and manage are here.
- `/boot`: kernel boot loader files.
- `/media`: a base attachment point for removable media.
- `/opt`: may contain additional third-party software.

## Chapter 3. Devices

### 3.1 Device Files
Kernel present many of the device I/O interfaces to user processes as files. Kernel decides what to do with any data written to this device.

Ex: `echo blah blar > /dev/null` thì kernel sẽ ignore input.

#### Block device
Ex: sda

#### Character device

#### Pipe device

#### Socket device


### 3.2 The sysfs Device Path

### 3.3 dd and Devices
dd is used for reading from an input file or stream and write to an output file or stream.

### 3.4 Device Name Summary
#### hard disks
#### terminals
#### Sserial ports
#### parallel ports
