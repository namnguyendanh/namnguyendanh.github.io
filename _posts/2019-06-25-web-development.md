# Web Development in 2019 - A Practical Guide

## Basis Software & Tools
**Text Editor or IDE**: VSCode, Sublime Text
**Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox

## HTML & CSS
Always the very first thing to learn
- Semantic HTML5 Elements
- Basis CSS
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- CSS Variables
- Browser Dev Tools

## Responsive Layout
Responsive layouts are no longer a luxury, they are a necessity.

- Set viewport
- Fluid widths
- Media queries
- `rem` over `px`
- Mobile first, stacked columns

## Basic Deployment
Learn to deploy a static website

- Register a domain name: Namecheap, Google Domains
- Managed shared hosting or VPS: Inmotion, Hostgator, Bluehost
- FTP, SFTP FIle Upload: Filezilla, Cyberduck
- Static Hosting: Netlify, Github Pages

## Sass Pre-processor
Not mandatory but recommended. It is easy enough to learn the basics.

- Structured CSS
- Variables
- Nested CSS
- Mixins & Functions
- Inheritance

## Vanilla JavaScript
Start learning JS without any library or framework.

- Data types, functions, conditionals, loops, operators
- DOM Manipulation & Events
- JSON
- Fetch API
- ES6+ (Arrow functions, promises, async / await, destructuring)

That is enough to become a
## Basic Front-End Web Developer
- Build static websites (small business, informational)
- Build UI layouts (Take a design and create the html/css)
- Add dynamic functionality (modals, slidshows, etc)
- Deploy and maintain websites

-> Freelancing is a possibility

## What to Learn Next ?
What to do next depends on what you want to do. You have a few choices.
- HTML/CSS Framework
- Git & Tooling
- Front End JS Framework
- Server Side Language & Database

## HTML/CSS Framework
- Bootstrap -> easier and great for prototyping

## Git & Tooling
Git is absolutely necessary for all web developers. Here are some other tooling suggestions:
- Basic Command Line
- Git
- NPM or Yarn: installing packages
- Webpack or Parcel: module bundling
- Gulp or Grunt
- Editor Extensions

## Front-End Framework
It is becoming a necessity to learn a JS front-end framework
- Very popular in the industry
- More interactive & interesting UIs
- Components & modular front end code
- Good for teams

**React**: most popular in the industry
**Vue**: Easy to use and really gaining traction
**Angular**: Fading a bit - used in enterprise

## State Management
For larger apps with a framework, you may need to learn methods to manage app-level state

- Redux, Context API
- Apollo (GraphQL Client)
- VueX
- NgRx

That is enough to become a
## Full Fledged Front-End Web Developer
- Build incredible front-end applications
- Smooth & steady front-end workflow
- Work well with teams & familiar with Git
- Connect to backend APIs & work with data

## Server Side Language
To be a full stack or software engineer, you will need to learn a server-side language/technology

- Node.js
- Python
- PHP
- C#
- Go

## Server Side Framework
Do not reinvent the wheel. Learn a framework to build better and faster
- Node.js: Express, Koa, Adonis
- Python: Django, Flask
- PHP: Laravel, Symfony
- C#: ASP.NET

## Database (1 or 2)
Most applications will use some kind of database. There are different types, here are some options
- Relational Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Couchbase
- Cloud: Firebase, AWS, Azure DocumentDB
- Lightweight: SQLite, NeDB, Redis

## Server Rendered Pages
Frameworks like React, Vue & Angular can also be rendered on the server which can actually make things relatively easier.

- Next.js: React
- Nuxt.js: Vue
- Angular Universal: Angular

## Content management systems (1)
CMS allow for quick development and give your clients the ability to update their content. May not be a bad idea to pick one up. Great for freelancers

- PHP Based: Wordpress, Drupal
- JS Based: Ghost, Keystone
- Python Based: Mezzazine
- .NET Piranha, Orchard CMS

## DevOps, Deployment & More
Learning languages and frameworks is one thing, setting up environments, testing & deployment is another.

- Deployment: Linux, SSH, Git, Server Software (Nginx, Apache)
- Platforms: Digital Ocean, AWS, Heroku, Azure
- Virtualization: Docker, Vagrant
- Testing: Unit, Integration, Functional, System

## Full Stack Developer
- Setup full stack dev env & workflows
- Build back-end APIs & micro-services
- Work with databases
- Construct full-stack apps (front-end framework & server)
- Deploy to the cloud (SSH, Git, Servers, etc)

## Mobile Development (1)
There are some frameworks that allow us to create native apps with web technologies

- React Native: build native apps with React
- NativeScript: Angular, TypeScript, JS
- Ionic: Hybrid apps with HTML/CSS/JS
- Flutter: Mobile SDK for Android & iOS (Users Dart)
- Xamarin: Mobile apps with C#

## Desktop Apps with Electron
Electron is used to build powerful cross-platform desktop apps using JS.
- Use Chromium & Node.js
- Compatible with Windows, Mac & Linux
- Crash reporting, debugging & profiling

## GraphQL & Apollo
GraphQL is a revolutionary new way to think about APIs. Query language that is much less rigid than standard **REST**

- Ask for only what you want
- Front & back end can collaborate more smoothly
- Writing queries are very easy and similar to JSON
- Apollo is a client to make requests to a GraphQL server
- Used with the Gatsby static site generator

## TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JS with additional features including static typing
- Types for variables, functions, etc
- Classes
- Other ES6-like features
- Used in Angular but can be implemented in React & Vue

## Serverless Architecture
Eliminate the need for creating and managing your own server

- Use 3rd party services to execute "Serverless functions" (FaaS)
- Examples are AWS, Netlify & Firebase
- Popular with Gatsby static sites
- Serverless framework: toolkit for building serverless apps

## AI & Machine Learning
AL & ML have been huge in almost every are of programming & technology including web development

- ML can allow web apps to adapt over time
- AI has a long way to go but I suspect we will see more of it in web dev.
- Used heavily in Python but we also have JS libraries like Tensorflow.js and Brain.js

## Blockchain Technology
Companies are using Blockchain for digital transactions in order to make them more efficient and secure.
- Solidity: language for implementing contracts
- Mist: used for storing Ethereum, sending transactions & contracts
- Coinbase API: blockchain devs can easily build apps and integrate Bitcoin

## Progressive Web Apps
PWA are regular web apps but give the user a native app experience in terms of layout and functionality

- Responsive to fit any form factor
- Service workers for offline availability
- App-like interactions
- HTTPS
- Reliable, fast & engaging

## Web Assembly
Assembly-like binary format for code that can be executed by web browsers. Can be generated from higher level languages like C/C++ & Rust.

- Faster than JS
- Secure - Enforces same origin & security policies in the browser
- Open & debuggable
