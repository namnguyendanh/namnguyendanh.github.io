<!--# Tóm tắt sách: Radical Focus - Christina Wodtke-->

Đây là cuốn sách đầu tiên mình đọc trong năm nay, cuốn sách nói về **OKR** (Objective Key Results) - phương pháp đặt mục tiêu hiệu quả được áp dụng bởi 2 giant tech là Intel và Google. Công ty mình cũng đang bắt đầu áp dụng OKR cho năm 2019 vì thế nên mình muốn tìm hiểu về cách sử dụng OKR, trước hết là cho bản thân (individual OKR). Đây là [OKR cá nhân](https://trello.com/b/WVzZ4pQA/personal-okrs-%C4%91minh-ds) của mình. 

Vì mục đích là ứng dụng OKR cho bản thân nên mình có lọc bớt một số phần cảm thấy chưa cần thiết. Phần [Kết luận](#K%E1%BA%BFt-lu%E1%BA%ADn) sẽ nêu quan điểm cá nhân của mình.

 

## Introduction 

**MBO – Management by Objectives** has 2 principles: 
- Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what you need done and let them surprise you with their results. -> motivate people to do their best work. 
- Performance is measured by results. -> meaningfully measure progress. 

It's not important to protect an idea. It's important to protect the time it takes to make it real. -> Need a system to keep you and your team aimed at your goal. 

**Insipring and Measureable Goals**

OKRs: promote rapid and sustained growth. Được đặt theo năm hoặc theo quý. Objective tốt khiến người ta muốn thực hiện, Key Results tốt khiến người ta cảm thấy hơi chừng bước. 

**Tying Actions to Goals** 

Review priorities each week, you discover what conditions allow you to achieve them and what keep you from getting things done. 

**Cadence** 

Starting every week with a public setting of priorities is powerful. You commit to the team and to each other to make the Objective occur. A Friday celebration of what's been accomplished is the second bookend of a high-performing team's week. This commit/celebrate cadence creates a habit of execution. 

**Beware of distraction**

A startup's enemy is time, and the enemy of timely execution is distraction. By setting good goals and committing to working toward them each week, while celebrating your victories, a company can having amazing and focused growth. 

## The Framework for Radical Focus 

### Why we can't get things done ? 
- **We haven't prioritized our goals**. "If everything is important, nothing is important" - 
- **We haven't communicated the goal obsessively and comprehensively**. -> repeating the goal every Monday meetings, weekly status emails, Friday wins celebrations. 
- **We don't have a plan to get things done**. You need a process that helps you make sense of the work you need to do, and keeps you on track even when you are tired. 
- **We haven't made time for what matters**. Need deadline. 
- **We give up instead of iterate**. Track closely what works, and what does not, and you do more of what works and less of what doesn't. The heart of success is learning. 

 
### Before Starting OKRs, Checking your Mission 
A good mission is short enough everyone in the company can keep it in their head. Great missions are inspirational, yet directed. Your mission is short and memorable. When you have a question in your daily work life, the mission should be top of mind to help you answer. A mission keeps you on the rails. The OKRs provide focus and milestones. Using OKRs without a mission is like using jet fuel without a jet. It's messy, undirected and potentially destructive. 

Start with this simple formula: "We [reduce pain/improve live] in [market] by [value proposition]." 

Ex: Google - "To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful" 
 

## OKR Fundamentals 

### OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. 

The Objective is qualitative, and the KRs (most often 3) are quantitative. They are used to focus a group or individual around a bold goal. The Objective establishes a goal for a set period of time, usually a quarter. The Key Results tell you if the Objective has been met by the end of the time. 

 

#### Objective 

Qualitative and Inspirational.  

Time Bound. Ex: month, quarter, if it take a year, your objective may be a strategy or maybe even a mission. 

Actionable be the Team Independently. Inspire the team, hard but not impossible. 

 

#### Key Results 

Take all that inspirational language and quantify it. You create them by asking a simple question, "How would we know if we met our Objective?". 

Key Results can based on anything you can measure, include: growth, engeagement, revenue, performance, quality. 

KRs should be difficult, not impossible. 

 

### What Make OKRs Works ? 

#### OKRs Cascade 

The company should set an OKR, and then each department should determine how their OKR leads to the company’s successful OKR. A team can focus their OKR on a single KR or try to support the entire set. 

Each individual should set individual OKRs that reflect both personal growth and support the company's goals. 

#### OKRs are Part of Your Regular Rhythm 

Not having tracking(meetings, adjust confidence levels,...) = Fail to achieve Objectives. 

#### OKRs Provide an Unmoving and Clear Goal 

Do not change OKRs halfway through the quarter. No team get ORK perfect the first time, use that learning to set them better next time. 

OKRs aren't about hitting targets, but about learning what you are really capable of. 

 

### OKRs for Product Teams 

A product team is a cross-functional set of professionals, typically comprised of a product manager, a product designer, and a small number of engineers. Each product team typically is responsible for some significant part of the company’s product offering or technology.  

OKRs help to ensure that each team is aligned with the objectives of the company.  

 

### Setting a Rhythm of Execution 

It's important to have a cadence of commitment and celebration. Scrum is a technique used by engineers to commit to progress and hold each other both accountable and to support each other. Each week an engineer shares what happened las week, what the commit to doing next week, and any blockers that keep them from their goals. 

 

#### Monday Commitments 

Each Monday, the team should meet to check in on progress against OKRs, and commit to the tasks that will help the company meet its Objective.  

Meeting and Conversation. 

#### Friday Celebrations 

Each team share something they have done. Celebrate on the success of team's progress. 

OKRs are great for setting goals, but without a system to achieve them, they are as likely to fail as any other process that is in fashion. 


### How to Hold a Meeting to Set OKRs for the Quarter  

Discuss. Debate. Fight. Stack rank. Pick 
… 
Design Thinking, brainstorm 

Connecting Company Business Objectives with Service Department OKRs 
… 

#### The Timing of OKRs 
- All employees submit the Objective they think the company should persue next quarter.
- Exec team debate, selecting, stack ranking, grouping, freelisting -> CEO approval. 
- Give OKRs to subteams, subteam develop their own 
- Optional: individual OKRs approved by manager. 

Fail -> learn -> improve  

### Weekly Status Emails (báo cáo tuần) 
- List team's OKRs 
- List last week's prioritized tasks and if they were achieved 
- List next week's priorities. 
- List any risks or blockers 
- Notes 

### Common OKR Mistakes 
- Set too many goals per quarter 
- Set OKRs for a week or a month  
- Set a metric-driven objective 
- Don’t set confidence levels 
- Don't track changing confidence levels 
- Use the four-square on Monday as a status report, not as a conversation 
- Talk tough on Friday 

### Quick Tips on OKRs Use 
- Set only one OKR for the company 
- Give 3 months for an OKR 
- Keep the metrics out the Objective. The Objective is inspirational 
- Weekly checking, do with company OKR then group's 
- OKRs cascade: company->team->individuals 
- OKRs are not the only thing you do, they are the one thing you must do. Don't jam every task into your OKRs. 
- Monday OKR checkin is a conversation. 
- Encourage employees to suggest company OKRs. 
- Make OKRs available publicly 
- Friday celebration is an antidote to Monday's business. 

## Kết luận  

Về phương diện ứng dụng cho cá nhân, mình thấy OKR hiệu quả bởi vì nó có hai yếu tố quan trọng: TẬP TRUNG và HỌC HỎI. 

- Tập trung: Objective ngắn gọn dễ nhớ, được chọn lựa, có yếu tố thúc đẩy người ta thực hiện, được định lượng rõ ràng bằng Key Results. Nó chỉ ra cho bạn phương hướng để hoạt động, điều cực kỳ quan trọng mà mình và nhiều người trẻ khác đang thiếu. 

- Học hỏi: OKR chỉ ra "what you are capable of". OKR không chỉ là đặt ra mục tiêu mà là còn kiểm soát, theo dõi quá trình làm việc, buộc bản thân phải học hỏi từ sai lầm, tự thay đổi tích cực hơn.
