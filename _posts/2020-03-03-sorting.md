## Introduction

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. (GeeksForGeeks)

## Sorting in Python
```python
def sortSecond(val):
    return val[i]

list1 = [(1, 2), (3, 3), (1, 1)]

list1.sort(key=sortSecond, reverse=True)

print(list1)
```
```
>>> [(3, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)]
```
